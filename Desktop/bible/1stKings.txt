I Kings

1Kgs.1:1 Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he got no heat.
1Kgs.1:2 Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.
1Kgs.1:3 So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
1Kgs.1:4 And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king had sexual contact with her not.
1Kgs.1:5 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
1Kgs.1:6 And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why have you done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare him after Absalom.
1Kgs.1:7 And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.
1Kgs.1:8 But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.
1Kgs.1:9 And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:
1Kgs.1:10 But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.
1Kgs.1:11 Wherefore Nathan spoke unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith does reign, and David our lord knows it not?
1Kgs.1:12 Now therefore come, let me, I pray you, give you counsel, that you may save yours own life, and the life of your son Solomon.
1Kgs.1:13 Go and get you in unto king David, and say unto him, Did not you, my lord, O king, swear unto yours handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then does Adonijah reign?
1Kgs.1:14 Behold, while you yet talk there with the king, I also will come in after you, and confirm your words.
1Kgs.1:15 And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.
